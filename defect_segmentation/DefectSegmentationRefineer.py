        see also Segmenter.infer_region_statistics() for more details.
        Following commented is the start of a solution that I didn't have time to complete, but is another idea:
        After a good segmentation, statistics of pixel color per segment type (there are 3) can be obtained.
        Then, each pixel can be classified as defect/good by its color relative to its segment.
        Early research showed there are 3 gaussian peaks, roughly centered at gray levels 50, 100, 150.

        I didn't have time to create a full working solution like this because my segmentation was lacking.
